# ***FYP Diary*** 

This is a diary that will document my progress of the development of my game. 

<br>

## **Term 1**

<br>

- ***Week 1-7*** <br>
The first weeks were used to carry out research and lay the groundwork for my project. As I had never used a game engine such as Unity before, I took a few weeks to familiarise myself with the engine and with C#, the language used by Unity (which was also new to me).  In addition, I also dedicated some time to study the basics of game development as a whole in order to understand what kind of approach I should take towards my FYP.

<br>

- ***Week 8*** 
    - *Monday, 19:15* - Pushed my empty project to my repository together with a new created .gitignore file.

<br>

- ***Week 9*** 
    - *Monday, 21:17* - Designed my own first sprite for an initial spaceship (may be subject to change) in a pixel editor. Added it to my Unity project as well as some basic code to implement left and right movement with the A and D keys.

    - *Thursday, 16:02* - Started drafting my interim report. Planned for some of it contents: part of the project plan will be used, such as the planning and the risk assessment. I will update my aims for the game and include these diary entries too.

<br>

 - ***Week 10*** 
    - *Wednesday, 15:14* - Noticed an issue with the sprite movement that caused the sprite to slide a little after letting go of the key instead of coming to a full stop. This was solved by changing Input.GetAxis() to Input.GetAxisRaw(), as the first one returned a float instead of either 1 or 0, causing the sprite to slide. <br>
    Also started the implementation of the spaceship's bullet mechanics. Only one bullet implemented so far with a simple script to spawn it and make it travel across the screen. I will add a timer to delete bullets after a few seconds. <br>
    Sprites need reworking as I would like to keep them as 16, or maybe 32 bits.

    - *Thursday, 15:45* - Implemented bullet shooting mechanics for one gun, player can now move and shoot. The bullets are deleted after one second to not fill the memory. I will add a power up for multiple guns later on. <br>
    Started designing an enemy sprite.
