# ***FYP Diary*** 

This is a diary that will document my progress of the development of my game. 

<br>

## **Term 1**

<br>

- ***Week 1-7*** <br>
The first weeks were used to carry out research and lay the groundwork for my project. As I had never used a game engine such as Unity before, I took a few weeks to familiarise myself with the engine and with C#, the language used by Unity (which was also new to me).  In addition, I also dedicated some time to study the basics of game development as a whole in order to understand what kind of approach I should take towards my FYP.

- ***Week 8*** 
    - *Monday, 19:15* - Pushed my empty project to my repository together with a new created .gitignore file.
